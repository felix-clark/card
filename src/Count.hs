-- module for blackjack card-counting functions

-- this should be implemented in terms of folds?

-- the most basic counting system
countHiLo :: Num a => Card -> a

  | rank >= Ten   = -1
  | otherwise     =  0

-- Knockout system: unbalanced, easier since it uses running count only
countKO :: Num a => Card -> a
